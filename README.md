# MINI-PROJECT
🤖 Precision farming mini project using machine learning to recommend the most suitable crops based on soil and environmental factors.

# 🌾 Precision Farming: A Machine Learning-Based Crop Recommender

Welcome to our group mini project! This system is designed to help farmers make informed decisions using machine learning. It recommends crops, predicts yield, forecasts weather, and suggests fertilizers — all through an easy-to-use web interface. This project was successfully published in a journal as part of our academic work. 📘✨

## 📌 Project Overview

This smart farming system is a unified ML-based solution that brings together:
- 🌱 Crop Recommendation based on soil and environmental inputs
- 🌾 Yield Prediction for specific crops
- 🌦️ Real-Time Weather Forecasting
- 💊 Fertilizer Suggestions tailored to weather data
- 📊 Visual Charts for better insight

All integrated into a Flask-powered web application.
